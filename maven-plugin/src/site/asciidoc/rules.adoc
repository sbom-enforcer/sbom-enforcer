= Rules

By default, the SBOM Enforcer Maven Plugin offers the following rules.

[#checksum]
== `checksum`

The `checksum` rules does not have any configuration option and verifies that the checksums included in the SBOM are correct.
Since the Maven local repository is used both as cache for consumed artifacts and staging area for published artifacts, it might happen that its content differs from the originals on Maven Central.

[TIP]
====
This rule is mostly useful in a `release` profile, together with the
link:./check-mojo.html#forcedependencyupdate[`forceDependencyUpdate`]
plugin parameter.
====

[#validate-references]
== `validateReferences`

The `validateReferences` checks the URLs contained in your SBOM file to look for broken links.
It accepts the following configuration options:

[#validate-references-check-dependencies]
=== `checkDependencies`

[cols="1h,5"]
|===

| Type
| `boolean`

| Default
| `true`

| Description
|
If `true` (default), the rule will also check the external references from dependency components.
|===

[#validate-references-fail-on-dependencies]
=== `failOnDependencies`

[cols="1h,5"]
|===

| Type
| `boolean`

| Default
| `false`

| Description
|
If `true`, the build will also fail if a broken link is encountered in a dependency component.
Otherwise, the problem is only logged.
|===

[#validate-references-fail-on-redirect]
=== `failOnRedirect`

[cols="1h,5"]
|===

| Type
| `boolean`

| Default
| `false`

| Description
|
If `true`, the rule will fail if any reference returns a `301` or `302` code.
|===

[#validate-references-fail-on-auth]
=== `failOnAuth`

[cols="1h,5"]
|===

| Type
| `boolean`

| Default
| `false`

If `true`, the rule will fail if any reference returns a `401` or `403` code.
|===

[#validate-references-max-failures-per-host]
=== `maxFailuresPerHost`

[cols="1h,5"]
|===

| Type
| `int`

| Default
| `3`

| Description
|
Maximum number of IO errors for each HTTP domain.
After the limit has been reached, the rule will ignore links to that HTTP domain.
|===

[#validate-references-timeout-ms]
=== `timeoutMs`

[cols="1h,5"]
|===

| Type
| `int`

| Default
| `5000`

| Description
|
Maximum number of milliseconds to wait for each URL.
|===

[#validate-references-includes]
=== `includes`

[cols="1h,5"]
|===

| Type
| `Set<String>`

| Default
| _empty_

| Description
|
Set of external reference types to include in the check.
If empty, all types will be checked.
See also <<validate-references-excludes>>.
|===

[#validate-references-excludes]
=== `excludes`

[cols="1h,5"]
|===

| Type
| `Set<String>`

By default `distribution-intake` is excluded, since it is not very useful to SBOM consumers and usually requires authentication.
